## Overview

This repository hosts the official public release of the white paper:

**“Cymatics Analysis and Testing: A Public White Paper”**

This research explores the resonance patterns formed by sound waves interacting with physical media. The study combines classical cymatics techniques with modern imaging and symmetry analysis to uncover new insights in wave dynamics and geometry.

## Abstract

Cymatics reveals the hidden architecture of vibration. Using controlled sound frequencies applied to metal plates and fluid surfaces, this study documents the formation of complex geometric patterns, their symmetry, and measurable relationships with frequency and boundary conditions.
